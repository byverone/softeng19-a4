1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
   - Task should be a string. We are only using the name of a Task. There is no functionality needed for Task to do anything. It would be pointless to have Task as a class for our current uses.
1. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
   - Future enhancemnts include:
     - add description for Task
     - update description for Task
     - view description for Task
     - start time for Task
     - completion time for Task
     - deadline for Task
     - view deadline for Task
     - view start/completion time for Task
     - Assign person to Task
     - Unassign person to Task
     - view people assigned to Task
     - view everything for Task
   - These changes would need Task to have functions and references to data. It would be best to make Task as a class. Functions would be easier to manage, that edit the data relative to that Task.
